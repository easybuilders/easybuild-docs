# Beta releases and release candidates for EasyBuild v5.0

Due to the large amount of changes in the upcoming EasyBuild v5.0 release,
we will tag a couple of pre-releases before releasing EasyBuild v5.0.0.

**Please consider testing these and providing feedback!**

## Beta release `5.0.0beta2` (24 Feb 2025) {: #beta2 }

!!! warning
    This is a pre-release that includes the majority of changes that will be included
    in EasyBuild v5.0.0.

    It can be used for testing and providing feedback (reporting bugs or unexpected behaviour, etc.).

    Additional changes can still be made before the release of EasyBuild v5.0.0, [see below][beta1_planned_changes].

### Highlighted changes

EasyBuild v5.0.0 will include some significant changes compared to EasyBuild v4.x.

Some of those changes are internal improvements and will be invisible to most users, but many others may need special attention
as they incorporate new features, changes of behavior or deprecations that can impact your workflow.

This includes (but is not limited to):

- **Python >= 3.6** is required to run EasyBuild (Python >= 3.9 is recommended);
- using **Lmod >= v8.0** or **Environment Modules >= v4.3.0** is required as modules tool (check with `module --version`);
- a new function named `run_shell_cmd` is used to run shell commands like `cmake`, `make`, `pip`, etc. (more info [here](run_shell_cmd.md));
- reproducible creation of source tarballs from Git repositories via `git_config` in `sources` easyconfig parameter (when using Python >= 3.9);
- additional configuration options (`module-search-path-headers` and `search-path-cpp-headers`) to control which paths are used to specify the location of header files;
- the `module_load_environment` variable in easyblocks to specify which environment variables should be updated by the generated environment module file;
- the **default setting of some configuration options has changed**:
    - **RPATH linking** is used by default (can be disabled with `--disable-rpath`);
    - **trace output** is enabled by default (can be disabled with `--disable-trace`);
    - Lua module files generated by EasyBuild will by default:
        - use `depends_on` rather than `load` (can be disabled with `--disable-module-depends-on`);
        - include an `extensions` statement to expose the list of included extensions (can be disabled with `--disable-module-extensions`);
    - the `use_pip` and `sanity_pip_check` custom easyconfig parameters used by the `PythonPackage` and `PythonBundle` easyblocks are enabled by default;
- **some functionality has been deprecated**, including:
    - `run_cmd` and `run_cmd_qa` functions (`run_shell_cmd` should be used instead);
    - `make_module_req_guess` method in easyblocks (`module_load_environment` should be used instead);
    - `parallel` easyconfig parameter (`maxparallel` easyconfig parameter or `parallel` property in easyblocks should be used instead);
- easyconfigs using an old [unsupported toolchain](../policies/toolchains.md) have been moved to the [easyconfigs archive](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs-archive);

### Installation

To install the 2nd beta release of EasyBuild v5.0.0 (`5.0.0beta2`), you can either:

- use the [provided easyconfig file](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/pull/22385), for example using:

    ```shell
    eb --from-pr 22385
    ```

- install into a Python virtual environment:

    ```shell
    tag='5.0.0beta2'

    venv_name="venv-eb-${tag}"
    python3 -m venv ${venv_name}
    unset PYTHONPATH
    source ${venv_name}/bin/activate
    
    pip install https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/archive/easybuild-framework-v${tag}.tar.gz
    pip install https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyblocks/archive/easybuild-easyblocks-v${tag}.tar.gz
    pip install https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/archive/easybuild-easyconfigs-v${tag}.tar.gz
    # optional dependencies for EasyBuild
    pip install archspec rich
    ```

### Planned additional changes {: #beta2_planned_changes }

A couple of additional changes that will be included in EasyBuild v5.0.0 are still a work-in-progress,
including (but not limited to):

- avoid hardcoding of `'CPATH'` in `modextrapaths` in easyconfig files, take into account `module-search-path-headers` configuration setting
  to determine whether `$CPATH` or `$_INCLUDE_PATH`/`$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH`/`$INCLUDE` should be updated by the generated
  module file;
- enhance LLVM easyblock for compilation of clang/flang + other llvm-projects (see [easyblocks PR #3373](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyblocks/pull/3373));
- add support for copying build log and build directory to a permanent location after installation failure (see
  [framework PR #4601](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/pull/4601));

For a complete overview of planned changes, see the [GitHub dashboard for EasyBuild v5.0](https://github.com/orgs/easybuilders/projects/18/views/2).

## FAQ

- *Do I need to reinstall all software that was installed with EasyBuild v4.x when I want to start using EasyBuild v5.x?*
  **No, you do not.** You can install additional software using EasyBuild v5.x on top of installations performed with EasyBuild v4.x.
