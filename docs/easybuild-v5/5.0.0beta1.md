# Beta release `5.0.0beta1` (24 Dec 2024)

!!! danger
    This is an older beta release of EasyBuild v5.0.0,
    which should no longer be used.

    Use [EasyBuild v5.0.0beta2](release-candidates.md#beta2) instead.

!!! warning
    This is an early pre-release that includes the majority of changes that will be included
    in EasyBuild v5.0.0.

    It can be used for testing and providing feedback (reporting bugs or unexpected behaviour, etc.).

    Additional changes can still be made before the release of EasyBuild v5.0.0, [see below][beta1_planned_changes].

## Highlighted changes

EasyBuild v5.0.0 will include some significant changes compared to EasyBuild v4.x.

Some of those changes are internal improvements and will be invisible to most users, but many others may need special attention
as they incorporate new features, changes of behavior or deprecations that can impact your workflow.

This includes (but is not limited to):

- **Python >= 3.6** is required to run EasyBuild (Python >= 3.9 is recommended);
- using **Lmod >= v8.0** or **Environment Modules >= v4.3.0** is required as modules tool (check with `module --version`);
- a new function named `run_shell_cmd` is used to run shell commands like `cmake`, `make`, `pip`, etc. (more info [here](run_shell_cmd.md));
- the **default setting of some configuration options has changed**:
    - **RPATH linking** is used by default (can be disabled with `--disable-rpath`);
    - **trace output** is enabled by default (can be disabled with `--disable-trace`);
    - Lua module files generated by EasyBuild will by default:
        - use `depends_on` rather than `load` (can be disabled with `--disable-module-depends-on`);
        - include an `extensions` statement to expose the list of included extensions (can be disabled with `--disable-module-extensions`);
    - reproducible creation of source tarballs from Git repositories via `git_config` in `sources` easyconfig parameter (when using Python >= 3.9);
    - the `use_pip` and `sanity_pip_check` custom easyconfig parameters used by the `PythonPackage` and `PythonBundle` easyblocks are enabled by default;
- **some functionality has been deprecated**, including the use of the `run_cmd` and `run_cmd_qa` functions (`run_shell_cmd` should be used instead);
- easyconfigs using an old [unsupported toolchain](../policies/toolchains.md) have been moved to the [easyconfigs archive](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs-archive);

## Installation {: #eb5.0.0beta1_installation }

    python3 -m venv ${venv_name}
    unset PYTHONPATH
    source ${venv_name}/bin/activate
    
    tag='5.0.0beta1'

## Planned additional changes {: #beta1_planned_changes }

A couple of additional changes that will be included in EasyBuild v5.0.0 are still a work-in-progress,
including (but not limited to):

- deprecating of `module_req_guess` method (see [framework PR #4653](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/pull/4653));
- deprecating of `parallel` easyconfig parameter (see [framework PR #4580](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/pull/4580));
