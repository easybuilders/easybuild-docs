# Wayland

Wayland is a project to define a protocol for a compositor to talk to  its clients as well as a library implementation of the protocol.  The  compositor can be a standalone display server running on Linux kernel  modesetting and evdev input devices, an X application, or a wayland  client itself.  The clients can be traditional applications, X servers  (rootless or fullscreen) or other display servers.
