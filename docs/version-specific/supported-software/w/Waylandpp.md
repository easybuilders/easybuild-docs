# Waylandpp

Wayland is an object oriented display protocol, which  features request and events. Requests can be seen as method calls on  certain objects, whereas events can be seen as signals of an object.  This makes the Wayland protocol a perfect candidate for a C++ binding.  The goal of this library is to create such a C++ binding for Wayland  using the most modern C++ technology currently available, providing  an easy to use C++ API to Wayland.
