# tbb

Intel Threading Building Blocks (Intel TBB)  is a widely used, award-winning C++ template library for creating reliable,  portable, and scalable parallel applications.  Use Intel TBB for a simple and rapid way of developing robust task-based  parallel applications that scale to available processor cores, are compatible  with multiple environments, and are easier to maintain.  Intel TBB is the most proficient way to implement future-proof parallel applications  that tap into the power and performance of multicore and manycore hardware platforms.
