# TotalView

TotalView is a GUI-based source code defect analysis tool that gives you unprecedented  control over processes and thread execution and visibility into program state and variables. It allows  you to debug one or many processes and/or threads in a single window with complete control over program  execution. This allows you to set breakpoints, stepping line by line through the code on a single thread,  or with coordinated groups of processes or threads, and run or halt arbitrary sets of processes or threads.  You can reproduce and troubleshoot difficult problems that can occur in concurrent programs that take  advantage of threads, OpenMP, MPI, GPUs or coprocessors.
