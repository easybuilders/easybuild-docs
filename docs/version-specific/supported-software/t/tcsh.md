# tcsh

Tcsh is an enhanced, but completely compatible version of the Berkeley UNIX C shell (csh).   It is a command language interpreter usable both as an interactive login shell and a shell script command   processor. It includes a command-line editor, programmable word completion, spelling correction, a history   mechanism, job control and a C-like syntax.
