# TRIQS-dft_tools

TRIQS (Toolbox for Research on Interacting Quantum Systems) is a  scientific project providing a set of C++ and Python libraries to  develop new tools for the study of interacting quantum systems.   This TRIQS-based-based application is aimed at ab-initio calculations   for correlated materials, combining realistic DFT band-structure calculations   with the dynamical mean-field theory. Together with the necessary tools to   perform the DMFT self-consistency loop for realistic multi-band problems,   the package provides a full-fledged charge self-consistent interface to the   Wien2K package. In addition, if Wien2k is not available, it provides a generic  interface for one-shot DFT+DMFT calculations, where only the single-particle   Hamiltonian in orbital space has to be provided.
