# Kraken

Kraken is a system for assigning taxonomic labels to short DNA sequences,  usually obtained through metagenomic studies. Previous attempts by other  bioinformatics software to accomplish this task have often used sequence  alignment or machine learning techniques that were quite slow, leading to  the development of less sensitive but much faster abundance estimation  programs. Kraken aims to achieve high sensitivity and high speed by  utilizing exact alignments of k-mers and a novel classification algorithm.
