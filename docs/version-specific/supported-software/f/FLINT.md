# FLINT

FLINT (Fast Library for Number Theory) is a C library in support of computations  in number theory. Operations that can be performed include conversions, arithmetic, computing GCDs,  factoring, solving linear systems, and evaluating special functions. In addition, FLINT provides  various low-level routines for fast arithmetic. FLINT is extensively documented and tested.
