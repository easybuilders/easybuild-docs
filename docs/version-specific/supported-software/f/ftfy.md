# ftfy

ftfy (fixes text for you) fixes Unicode that’s broken in various ways. The goal of ftfy is to take in bad Unicode and output good Unicode, for use in your Unicode-aware code. This is different from taking in non-Unicode and outputting Unicode, which is not a goal of ftfy. It also isn’t designed to protect you from having to write Unicode-aware code. ftfy helps those who help themselves.
