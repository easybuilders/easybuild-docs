# Faiss

Faiss is a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense  vectors. It contains algorithms that search in sets of vectors of any size, up  to ones that possibly do not fit in RAM. It also contains supporting code for  evaluation and parameter tuning. Faiss is written in C++ with complete  wrappers for Python/numpy. Some of the most useful algorithms are implemented  on the GPU. It is developed primarily at Meta's Fundamental AI Research group.
