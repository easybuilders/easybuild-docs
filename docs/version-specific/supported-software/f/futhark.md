# futhark

Futhark is a small programming language designed to be compiled to efficient parallel code. It     is a statically typed, data-parallel, and purely functional array language in the ML family, and comes     with a heavily optimising ahead-of-time compiler that presently generates GPU code via CUDA and OpenCL,     although the language itself is hardware-agnostic and can also run on multicore CPUs
