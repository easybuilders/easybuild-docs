# FFAVES

Functional Feature Amplification Via Entropy Sorting (FFAVES). Use FFAVES to amplify the signal of groups of co-regulating genes in an unsupervised, multivariate manner. By amplifying the signal of genes with correlated expression, while filtering out genes that are randomly expressed, we can identify a subset of genes more predictive of different cell types. The output of FFAVES can then be used in our second algorithm, entropy sort feature weighting (ESFW), to create a ranked list of genes that are most likely to pertain to distinct  sub-populations of cells in an scRNA-seq dataset.
