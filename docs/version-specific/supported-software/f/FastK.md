# FastK

FastK is a kâ€‘mer counter that is optimized for processing high quality DNA assembly data sets  such as those produced with an Illumina instrument or a PacBio run in HiFi mode. For example it is about 2 times  faster than KMC3 when counting 40-mers in a 50X HiFi data set. Its relative speedup decreases with increasing error  rate or increasing values of k, but regardless is a general program that works for any DNA sequence data set  and choice of k. It is further designed to handle data sets of arbitrarily large size, e.g. a 100X data  set of a 32GB Axolotl genome (3.2Tbp) can be performed on a machine with just 12GB of memory provided it  has ~6.5TB of disk space available.
