# phyluce

phyluce is a software package for working with data generated from sequence capture of UCE  (ultra-conserved element) loci, as first published in [BCF2012]. Specifically, phyluce is a suite of programs to: 1) assemble raw sequence reads from Illumina platforms into contigs 2) determine which contigs represent UCE loci 3) filter potentially paralagous UCE loci 4) generate different sets of UCE loci across taxa of interest
