# pytest-shard

pytest plugin to support parallelism across multiple machines.  Shards tests based on a hash of their test name enabling easy parallelism across machines, suitable for a wide variety of continuous integration services. Tests are split at the finest level of granularity, individual test cases, enabling parallelism even if all of your tests are in a single file (or even single parameterized test method).
