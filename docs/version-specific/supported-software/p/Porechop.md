# Porechop

Porechop is a tool for finding and removing adapters from Oxford Nanopore reads.  Adapters on the ends of reads are trimmed off, and when a read has an adapter in its middle,  it is treated as chimeric and chopped into separate reads. Porechop performs thorough alignments  to effectively find adapters, even at low sequence identity.
