# pybind11-stubgen

Static analysis tools and IDE usually struggle to understand python binary extensions. pybind11-stubgen generates stubs for python extensions to make them less opaque.  While the CLI tool includes tweaks to target modules compiled specifically with pybind11 but it should work well with modules built with other libraries.
