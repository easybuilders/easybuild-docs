# PMIx

Process Management for Exascale Environments PMI Exascale (PMIx) represents an attempt to resolve these questions by providing an extended version of the PMI standard specifically designed to support clusters up to and including exascale sizes. The overall objective of the project is not to branch the existing pseudo-standard definitions - in fact, PMIx fully supports both of the existing PMI-1 and PMI-2 APIs - but rather to (a) augment and extend those APIs to eliminate some current restrictions that impact scalability, and (b) provide a reference implementation of the PMI-server that demonstrates the desired level of scalability.
