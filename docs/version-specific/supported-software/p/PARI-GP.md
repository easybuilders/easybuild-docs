# PARI-GP

PARI/GP is a widely used computer algebra system designed for fast computations in number theory  (factorizations, algebraic  number theory, elliptic curves...), but also contains a large number of other useful  functions to compute with mathematical entities such as matrices, polynomials, power series, algebraic numbers etc.,  and a lot of transcendental functions. PARI is  also available as a C library to allow for faster computations.
