# PyFrag

The PyFrag program is specially designed to facilitate the analysis of reaction mechanism in a more efficient and user-friendly way. PyFrag resolves three main challenges associated with the automatized computational exploration of reaction mechanisms: 1) the management of multiple parallel calculations to automatically find a reaction path; 2) the monitoring of the entire computational process along with the extraction and plotting of relevant information from large amounts of data; and 3) the analysis and presentation of these data in a clear and informative way. This module provides the Activation Strain Analysis (ASA) Module of PyFrag 2023
