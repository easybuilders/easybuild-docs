# PyPSA

PyPSA is an open-source Python framework for optimising and simulating modern power and energy systems that include features such as conventional generators with unit commitment, variable wind and solar generation, hydro-electricity, inter-temporal storage, coupling to other energy sectors, elastic demands, and linearised power flow with loss approximations in DC and AC networks. PyPSA is designed to scale well with large networks and long time series. It is made for researchers, planners and utilities with basic coding aptitude who need a fast, easy-to-use and transparent tool for power and energy system analysis.
