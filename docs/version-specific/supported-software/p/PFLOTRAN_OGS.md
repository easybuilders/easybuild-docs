# PFLOTRAN_OGS

The PFLOTRAN-OGS development continues to focus on carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS), and compared to the previous version, the latest OGS-1.8 release adds the following new elements:  - Dynamic modelling of temperature for COMP3 and COMP4, to model thermal effects in depleted   hydrocarbon fields. - Well history to reproduce reservoir initial condition before CO2 storage, see HYSTORY_DATA   and ESCHED. - New correlations for the brine properties: Kestin [KKC81] for the viscosity, Rowe and Chou   [NBS77] and Ezrokhi [ZA93] for the density. - Support for TRANX/Y/Z and NNC in the GRDECL grids. - Transmissibility computation using a local diagonal tensor (LDT), to reproduce the exact   same transmissibility computation of industry standard reservoir simulators.
