# PAPI

PAPI provides the tool designer and application engineer with a consistent  interface and methodology for use of the performance counter hardware found  in most major microprocessors. PAPI enables software engineers to see, in near  real time, the relation between software performance and processor events.  In addition Component PAPI provides access to a collection of components  that expose performance measurement opportunites across the hardware and  software stack.
