# PyHMMER

HMMER is a biological sequence analysis tool that uses profile hidden Markov models to search for sequence homologs. HMMER3 is developed and maintained by the Eddy/Rivas Laboratory at Harvard University.  pyhmmer is a Python package, implemented using the Cython language, that provides bindings to HMMER3. It directly interacts with the HMMER internals, which has the following advantages over CLI wrappers (like hmmer-py)
