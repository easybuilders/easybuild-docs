# PGPLOT

The PGPLOT Graphics Subroutine Library is a Fortran- or C-callable,  device-independent graphics package for making simple scientific graphs. It is intended  for making graphical images of publication quality with minimum effort on the part of  the user. For most applications, the program can be device-independent, and the output  can be directed to the appropriate device at run time.
