# PPM

Positioning of proteins in flat and curved membranes. PPM 3.0 server features: - positioning of transmembrane and peripheral proteins and peptides in   membranes and micelles - calculation of binding modes and membrane affinity of proteins taking into   account the influence of hydrophobic matching and curvature stress - prediction of protein-induced membrane deformations - calculations in flat artificial and natural membranes - calculations in curved membranes with adjustable radii of curvature - calculations in spherical micelles of different sizes - positioning of proteins spanning two parallel membranes (e.g. outer and inner   membranes of Gram-negative bacteria) - approximation of deformed membrane surfaces by several (up to four) flat   surfaces - using polarity profiles along the membrane normal for the DOPC   (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) bilayer [PubMed] - using hydrophobic thicknesses (± 5Å) of artificial lipid bilayers   (experimental values) and of different biological membranes (average values   obtained from the large-scale analysis of transmembrane proteins from the OPM   database)
