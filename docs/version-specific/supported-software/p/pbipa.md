# pbipa

Improved Phased Assembler (IPA) is the official PacBio software for HiFi genome assembly. IPA was designed to utilize the accuracy of PacBio HiFi reads to produce high-quality phased genome assemblies. IPA is an end-to-end solution, starting with input reads and resulting in a polished assembly. IPA is fast, providing an easy to use local run mode or a distributed pipeline for a cluster.
