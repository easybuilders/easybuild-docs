# graph-tool

Graph-tool is an efficient Python module for manipulation and  statistical analysis of graphs (a.k.a. networks). Contrary to  most other python modules with similar functionality, the core  data structures and algorithms are implemented in C++, making  extensive use of template metaprogramming, based heavily on  the Boost Graph Library. This confers it a level of  performance that is comparable (both in memory usage and  computation time) to that of a pure C/C++ library.
