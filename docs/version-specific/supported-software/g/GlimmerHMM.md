# GlimmerHMM

GlimmerHMM is a new gene finder based on a Generalized Hidden Markov Model.  Although the gene finder conforms to the overall mathematical framework of a GHMM, additionally  it incorporates splice site models adapted from the GeneSplicer program and a decision tree adapted  from GlimmerM. It also utilizes Interpolated Markov Models for the coding and noncoding models.
