# GObject-Introspection

GObject introspection is a middleware layer between C libraries  (using GObject) and language bindings. The C library can be scanned at  compile time and generate a metadata file, in addition to the actual  native C library. Then at runtime, language bindings can read this  metadata and automatically provide bindings to call into the C library.
