The Genome Analysis Toolkit or GATK is a software package developed at the Broad Institute  to analyse next-generation resequencing data. The toolkit offers a wide variety of tools,  with a primary focus on variant discovery and genotyping as well as strong emphasis on  data quality assurance. Its robust architecture, powerful processing engine and  high-performance computing features make it capable of taking on projects of any size.
