# GenomeMapper

GenomeMapper is a short read mapping tool designed for accurate read alignments.   It quickly aligns millions of reads either with ungapped or gapped alignments.   This version is used to align against a single reference.   If you are unsure which one is the appropriate GenomeMapper, you might want to use this one.
