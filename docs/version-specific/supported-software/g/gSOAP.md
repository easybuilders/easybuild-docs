# gSOAP

The gSOAP toolkit is a C and C++ software development toolkit for  SOAP and REST XML Web services and generic C/C++ XML data bindings.  The toolkit analyzes WSDLs and XML schemas (separately or as a combined set) and maps the XML schema types  and the SOAP/REST XML messaging protocols to easy-to-use and efficient C and C++ code.  It also supports exposing (legacy) C and C++ applications as XML Web services  by auto-generating XML serialization code and WSDL specifications.  Or you can simply use it to automatically convert XML to/from C and C++ data.  The toolkit supports options to generate pure ANSI C or C++ with or without STL.
