# GKeyll

Gkeyll v2.0 (pronounced as in the book “The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll  and Mr. Hyde”) is a computational plasma physics code mostly written in C/C++ and LuaJIT.  Gkeyll contains solvers for gyrokinetic equations, Vlasov-Maxwell equations, and  multi-fluid equations. Gkeyll contains ab-initio and novel implementations of a number  of algorithms, and perhaps is unique in using a JIT compiled typeless dynamic language  for as its main implementation language.
