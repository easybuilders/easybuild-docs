# GTK3

GTK+ is the primary library used to construct user interfaces in GNOME. It  provides all the user interface controls, or widgets, used in a common  graphical application. Its object-oriented API allows you to construct  user interfaces without dealing with the low-level details of drawing and  device interaction.
