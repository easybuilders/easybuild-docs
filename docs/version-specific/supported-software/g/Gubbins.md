# Gubbins

Gubbins (Genealogies Unbiased By recomBinations In Nucleotide Sequences) is an algorithm that  iteratively identifies loci containing elevated densities of base substitutions, which are marked as recombinations,  while concurrently constructing a phylogeny based on the putative point mutations outside of these regions.  Simulations demonstrate the algorithm generates highly accurate reconstructions under realistic models of short-term  bacterial evolution, and can be run in only a few hours on alignments of hundreds of bacterial genome sequences.
