# nghttp2

This is an implementation of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol version 2 in C.  The framing layer of HTTP/2 is implemented as a reusable C library.  On top of that, we have implemented an HTTP/2 client, server and proxy.  We have also developed load test and benchmarking tools for HTTP/2.  An HPACK encoder and decoder are available as a public API.
