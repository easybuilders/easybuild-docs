# NiBabel

NiBabel provides read/write access to some common medical and neuroimaging file formats,  including: ANALYZE (plain, SPM99, SPM2 and later), GIFTI, NIfTI1, NIfTI2, MINC1, MINC2, MGH and ECAT  as well as Philips PAR/REC. We can read and write Freesurfer geometry, and read Freesurfer morphometry and  annotation files. There is some very limited support for DICOM. NiBabel is the successor of PyNIfTI.
