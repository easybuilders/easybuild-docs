# rootpy

The rootpy project is a community-driven initiative aiming to provide a more pythonic interface with  ROOT on top of the existing PyROOT bindings. Given Python’s reflective and dynamic nature, rootpy also aims to  improve ROOT design flaws and supplement existing ROOT functionality. The scientific Python community also offers a  multitude of powerful packages such as SciPy, NumPy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, and PyTables, but a suitable interface  between them and ROOT has been lacking. rootpy provides the interfaces and conversion mechanisms required to liberate  your data and to take advantage of these alternatives if needed.
