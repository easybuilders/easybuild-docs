# r5py

R5py is a Python library for rapid realistic routing on multimodal transport networks (walk, bike, public transport and car). It provides a simple and friendly interface to R5, the Rapid Realistic Routing on Real-world and Reimagined networks, the routing engine developed by Conveyal. r5py is inspired by r5r, a wrapper for R, and the library is designed to interact with GeoPandas GeoDataFrames.  R5py offers a simple way to run R5 locally with Python. It allows users to calculate travel time matrices and accessibility by different travel modes. To get started, see a detailed demonstration of the r5py ‘in action’ from the Usage section of its documentation. Over time, r5py will be expanded to incorporate other functionalities from R5.
