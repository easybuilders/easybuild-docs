# R-crumble

Implements a modern, unified estimation strategy for common mediation estimands (natural effects, organic effects, interventional effects, and recanting twins) in combination with modified treatment policies as described in: Liu, Williams, Rudolph, and Díaz (2024) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2408.14620>. Estimation makes use of recent advancements in Riesz-learning to estimate a set of required nuisance parameters with deep learning. The result is the capability to estimate mediation effects with binary, categorical, continuous, or multivariate exposures with high-dimensional mediators and mediator-outcome confounders using machine learning.
