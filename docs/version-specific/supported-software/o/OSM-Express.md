# OSM-Express

OSM Express is a fast storage format for OpenStreetMap that powers SliceOSM. It's designed as a low level building block specific to the OSM data model; common access patterns such as random lookups by ID, in-place minutely updates, and spatial queries are efficient and simple to manage in production applications.
