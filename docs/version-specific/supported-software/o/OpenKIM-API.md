# OpenKIM-API

Open Knowledgebase of Interatomic Models.  OpenKIM is an API and a collection of interatomic models (potentials) for atomistic simulations.  It is a library that can be used by simulation programs to get access to the models in the OpenKIM database.  This EasyBuild only installs the API, the models have to be installed by the user by running     kim-api-collections-management install user MODELNAME or     kim-api-collections-management install user OpenKIM to install them all.
