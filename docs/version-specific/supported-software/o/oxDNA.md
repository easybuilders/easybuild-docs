# oxDNA

oxDNA is a simulation code that was initially conceived as an implementation  of the coarse-grained DNA model introduced by T. E. Ouldridge, J. P. K. Doye and A. A. Louis.  It has been since reworked and it is now an extensible simulation+analysis framework.  It natively supports DNA, RNA, Lennard-Jones and patchy particle simulations of different kinds  on both single CPU cores and NVIDIA GPUs.
