# Ludwig

Ludwig is a parallel code for the simulation of complex fluids, which include mixtures, colloidal suspensions, gels, and liquid crystals. It takes its name from Ludwig Boltzmann, as it uses a lattice Boltzmann method as a basis for numerical solution of the Navier Stokes equations for hydrodynamics. It typically combines hydrodynamics with a coarse-grained order parameter (or order parameters) to represent the "complex" part in a free energy picture.  The code is written in standard ANSI C, and uses the Message Passing Interface for distributed memory parallelism. Threaded parallelism is also available via a lightweight abstraction layer ("Target Data Parallel" or "TargetDP") which currently supports OpenMP, CUDA (NVIDIA GPUs) or HIP (AMD GPUs) from a single source.
