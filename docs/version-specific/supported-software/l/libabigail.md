ABIGAIL stands for the Application Binary Interface Generic Analysis and Instrumentation Library.  It’s a framework which aims at helping developers and software distributors to spot some ABI-related issues like interface incompatibility in ELF shared libraries by performing a static analysis of the ELF binaries at hand.  The type of interface incompatibilities that Abigail focuses on is related to changes on the exported ELF functions and variables symbols, as well as layout and size changes of data types of the functions and variables exported by shared libraries.  In other words, if the return type of a function exported by a shared library changes in an incompatible way from one version of a given shared library to another, we want Abigail to help people catch that.
