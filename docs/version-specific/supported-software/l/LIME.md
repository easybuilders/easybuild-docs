# LIME

LIME (which can stand for Lattice QCD Interchange Message Encapsulation or more generally, Large Internet Message Encapsulation) is a simple packaging scheme for combining records containing ASCII and/or binary data. Its ancestors are the Unix cpio and tar formats and the Microsoft Corporation DIME (Direct Internet Message Encapsulation) format. It is simpler and allows record sizes up to $2^{63}$ bytes, making chunking unnecessary for the foreseeable future. Unlike tar and cpio, the records are not associated with Unix files. They are identified only by a record-type (LIME type) character string, analogous to the familiar MIME application type. The LIME software package consists of a C-language API for creating, reading, writing, and manipulating LIME files and a small set of utilities for examining, packing and unpacking LIME files.
