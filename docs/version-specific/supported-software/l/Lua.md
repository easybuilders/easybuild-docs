# Lua

Lua is a powerful, fast, lightweight, embeddable scripting language.  Lua combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description constructs based  on associative arrays and extensible semantics. Lua is dynamically typed,  runs by interpreting bytecode for a register-based virtual machine,  and has automatic memory management with incremental garbage collection,  making it ideal for configuration, scripting, and rapid prototyping.
