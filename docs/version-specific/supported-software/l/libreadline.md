# libreadline

The GNU Readline library provides a set of functions for use by applications  that allow users to edit command lines as they are typed in. Both Emacs and  vi editing modes are available. The Readline library includes additional  functions to maintain a list of previously-entered command lines, to recall  and perhaps reedit those lines, and perform csh-like history expansion on  previous commands.
