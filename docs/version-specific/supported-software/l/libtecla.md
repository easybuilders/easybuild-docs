# libtecla

The tecla library provides UNIX and LINUX programs with interactive command line editing facilities,  similar to those of the UNIX tcsh shell. In addition to simple command-line editing, it supports recall of previously  entered command lines, TAB completion of file names or other tokens, and in-line wild-card expansion of filenames.  The internal functions which perform file-name completion and wild-card expansion are also available externally for  optional use by programs.
