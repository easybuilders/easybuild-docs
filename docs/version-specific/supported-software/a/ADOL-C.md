# ADOL-C

The package ADOL-C (Automatic Differentiation by OverLoading in C++) facilitates the evaluation of first and higher derivatives of vector functions that are defined by computer programs written in C or C++. The resulting derivative evaluation routines may be called from C/C++, Fortran, or any other language that can be linked with C.
