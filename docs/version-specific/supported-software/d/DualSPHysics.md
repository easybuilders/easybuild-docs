# DualSPHysics

DualSPHysics is based on the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics model named SPHysics.   The code is developed to study free-surface flow phenomena where Eulerian methods  can be difficult to apply, such as waves or impact of dam-breaks on off-shore  structures. DualSPHysics is a set of C++, CUDA and Java codes designed to deal  with real-life engineering problems.
