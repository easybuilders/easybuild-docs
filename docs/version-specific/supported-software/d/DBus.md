# DBus

D-Bus is a message bus system, a simple way for applications to talk  to one another.  In addition to interprocess communication, D-Bus helps  coordinate process lifecycle; it makes it simple and reliable to code  a "single instance" application or daemon, and to launch applications  and daemons on demand when their services are needed.
