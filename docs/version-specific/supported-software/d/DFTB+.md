# DFTB+

DFTB+ is a fast and efficient versatile quantum mechanical simulation package.  It is based on the   Density Functional Tight Binding (DFTB) method, containing almost all of the useful extensions which have been  developed for the DFTB framework so far.  Using DFTB+ you can carry out quantum mechanical simulations like with  ab-initio density functional theory based packages, but in an approximate way gaining typically around two order of  magnitude in speed.
