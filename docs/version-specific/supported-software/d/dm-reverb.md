# dm-reverb

Reverb is an efficient and easy-to-use data storage and transport system designed for machine learning research. Reverb is primarily used as an experience replay system for distributed reinforcement learning algorithms but the system also supports multiple data structure representations such as FIFO, LIFO, and priority queues.
