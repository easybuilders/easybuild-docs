# DSRC

DNA Sequence Reads Compression is an application designed for compression of data files  containing reads from DNA sequencing in FASTQ format. The amount of such files can be huge, e.g., a few  (or tens) of gigabytes, so a need for a robust data compression tool is clear. Usually universal compression  programs like gzip or bzip2 are used for this purpose, but it is obvious that a specialized tool can work better.
