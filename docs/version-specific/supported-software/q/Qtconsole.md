# Qtconsole

A rich Qt-based console for working with Jupyter kernels, supporting rich media output,  session export, and more. The Qtconsole is a very lightweight application that largely feels like a terminal,  but provides a number of enhancements only possible in a GUI,  such as inline figures, proper multiline editing  with syntax highlighting, graphical calltips, and more.
