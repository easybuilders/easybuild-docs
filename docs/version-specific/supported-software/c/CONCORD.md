# CONCORD

Revealing the underlying cell-state landscape from single-cell data requires overcoming the critical obstacles of batch integration, denoising, and dimensionality reduction. We present CONCORD, a unified framework that simultaneously addresses these challenges within a single self-supervised model. At its core, CONCORD implements a unified probabilistic sampling strategy that corrects batch effects via dataset-aware sampling and enhances biological resolution through hard-negative sampling.
