# clisops

The clisops package (pronounced "clie-sops") provides a python library for running data-reduction operations on Xarray data sets or files that can be interpreted by Xarray. These basic operations (subsetting, averaging and regridding) are likely to work where data structures are NetCDF-centric, such as those found in ESGF data sets.
