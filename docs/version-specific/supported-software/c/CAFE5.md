# CAFE5

Software for Computational Analysis of gene Family Evolution  The purpose of CAFE is to analyze changes in gene family size in a way that accounts for phylogenetic history and provides a statistical foundation for evolutionary inferences. The program uses a birth and death process to model gene gain and loss across a user-specified phylogenetic tree. The distribution of family sizes generated under this model can provide a basis for assessing the significance of the observed family size differences among taxa.
