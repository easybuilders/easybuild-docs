# Check

Check is a unit testing framework for C.  It features a simple interface for defining unit tests,  putting little in the way of the developer. Tests are run  in a separate address space, so both assertion failures  and code errors that cause segmentation faults or other  signals can be caught. Test results are reportable in  the following: Subunit, TAP, XML, and a generic logging format.
