# CSB

Computational Structural Biology Toolbox CSB is a python library and application framework, which can be used to solve    problems in the field of structural bioinformatics. If you are a                 bioinformatician, software engineer or a researcher working in this field,       chances are you may find something useful here. Our package consists of a few    major components: 1. Core class library - object-oriented, granular, with an emphasis on design    and clean interfaces. 2. Application framework - console applications ("protocols"), which consume     objects from the core library in order to build something executable (and        hopefully useful). 3. Test framework - ensures that the library actually works.
