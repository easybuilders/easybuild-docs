# CoSymLib

Cosymlib is a python library for computing continuous symmetry & shape measures (CSMs & CShMs). Although its main aim is to provide simple and ready-to-use tools for the analysis of the symmetry & shape of molecules, many of the procedures contained in cosymlib can be easily applied to any finite geometrical object defined by a set of vertices or a by mass distribution function.
