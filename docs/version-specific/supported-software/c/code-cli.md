Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages and runtimes (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Go, .NET). Begin your journey with VS Code with these introductory videos.  This module provides the command-line interface of Visual Studio Code that lets you control how you launch the editor. You can open files, install extensions, change the display language, and output diagnostics through command-line options.
