# chewBBACA

chewBBACA is a software suite for the creation and evaluation of core genome and whole genome MultiLocus Sequence Typing (cg/wgMLST) schemas and results. The "BBACA" stands for "BSR-Based Allele Calling Algorithm". BSR stands for BLAST Score Ratio as proposed by Rasko DA et al. The "chew" part adds extra coolness to the name and could be thought of as "Comprehensive and Highly Efficient Workflow".
