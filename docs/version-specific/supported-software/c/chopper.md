# chopper

Rust implementation of NanoFilt+NanoLyse, both originally written in Python. This tool, intended for long read sequencing such as PacBio or ONT, filters and trims a fastq file. Filtering is done on average read quality and minimal or maximal read length, and applying a headcrop (start of read) and tailcrop (end of read) while printing the reads passing the filter.
