# Caliper

Caliper is a performance instrumentation and profiling library for HPC (high-performance computing) programs. It provides source-code annotation APIs for marking regions of interest in C, C++, Fortran, and Python codes, as well as measurement functionality for a wide range of runtime profiling, event tracing, and performance monitoring use cases.  Caliper can generate simple human-readable reports or files for performance data analysis frameworks like Hatchet and Thicket. It can also generate detailed event traces for timeline visualizations with Perfetto and the Google Chrome trace viewer.
