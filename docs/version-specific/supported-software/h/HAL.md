# HAL

HAL is a structure to efficiently store and index multiple genome alignments and ancestral reconstructions. HAL is a graph-based representation which provides several advantages over matrix/block-based formats such as MAF, such as improved scalability and the ability to perform queries with respect to an arbitrary reference or subtree.  This package includes the HAL API and several analysis and conversion tools which are described below. HAL files are presently stored in either HDF5 or mmap format, but we note that the tools and most of the API are format-independent, so other databases could be implemented in the future.
