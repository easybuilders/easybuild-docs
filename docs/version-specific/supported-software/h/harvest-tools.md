# harvest-tools

HarvestTools is a utility for creating and interfacing with Gingr files, which are efficient archives that the Harvest Suite uses to store reference-compressed multi-alignments, phylogenetic trees, filtered variants and annotations. Though designed for use with Parsnp and Gingr, HarvestTools can also be used for generic conversion between standard bioinformatics file formats.
