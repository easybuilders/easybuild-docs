# hwloc-CUDA

The Portable Hardware Locality (hwloc) software package provides a portable  abstraction (across OS, versions, architectures, ...) of the hierarchical  topology of modern architectures, including NUMA memory nodes, sockets, shared  caches, cores and simultaneous multithreading. It also gathers various system  attributes such as cache and memory information as well as the locality of I/O  devices such as network interfaces, InfiniBand HCAs or GPUs. It primarily  aims at helping applications with gathering information about modern computing  hardware so as to exploit it accordingly and efficiently.   This provides the CUDA and NVML plugins for hwloc
