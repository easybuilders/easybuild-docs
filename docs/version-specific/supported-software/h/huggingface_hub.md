# huggingface_hub

The huggingface_hub library allows you to interact with the Hugging Face Hub, a platform democratizing open-source Machine Learning for creators and collaborators. Discover pre-trained models and datasets for your projects or play with the thousands of machine learning apps hosted on the Hub. You can also create and share your own models, datasets and demos with the community. The huggingface_hub library provides a simple way to do all these things with Python.
