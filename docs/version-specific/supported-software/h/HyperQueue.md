# HyperQueue

HyperQueue lets you build a computation plan consisting of a large amount of tasks and then execute it transparently over a system like SLURM/PBS. It dynamically groups jobs into SLURM/PBS jobs and distributes them to fully utilize allocated nodes. You thus do not have to manually aggregate your tasks into SLURM/PBS jobs.
