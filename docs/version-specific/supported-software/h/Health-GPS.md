# Health-GPS

Health-GPS microsimulation is part of the STOP project, and support researchers  and policy makers in the analysis of the health and economic impacts of alternative  measures to tackle chronic diseases and obesity in children. The model reproduces  the characteristics of a population and simulates key individual event histories  associated with key components of relevant behaviours, such as physical activity,  and diseases such as diabetes or cancer. To run the test-jobs with HealthGPS.Tests the data-directory, found in your installation folder, must be in the current path.
