# HPCViewer

hpcviewer is a graphical user interface that interactively presents performance data in three complementary code-centric views (top-down, bottom-up, and flat), as well as a graphical view that enables one to assess performance variability across threads and processes. hpcviewer is designed to facilitate rapid top-down analysis using derived metrics that highlight scalability losses and inefficiency rather than focusing exclusively on program hot spots.
