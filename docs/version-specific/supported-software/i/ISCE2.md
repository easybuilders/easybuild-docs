# ISCE2

ISCE is a framework designed for the purpose of processing Interferometric Synthetic  Aperture Radar (InSAR) data. The framework aspects of it have been designed as a general software  development framework. It may have additional utility in a general sense for building other  types of software packages. In its InSAR aspect ISCE supports data from many space-borne  satellites and one air-borne platform.
