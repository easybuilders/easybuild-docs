# Imlib2

This is the Imlib 2 library - a library that does image file loading and saving as well as rendering, manipulation, arbitrary polygon support, etc. It does ALL of these operations FAST. Imlib2 also tries to be highly intelligent about doing them, so writing naive programs can be done easily, without sacrificing speed.
