# InterOp

The Illumina InterOp libraries are a set of common routines used for reading InterOp metric files produced by Illumina sequencers including NextSeq 1k/2k and NovaSeqX. These libraries are backwards compatible and capable of supporting prior releases of the software, with one exception: GA systems have been excluded.
