# ispc

Intel SPMD Program Compilers; An open-source compiler for high-performance  SIMD programming on the CPU. ispc is a compiler for a variant of the C programming language,  with extensions for 'single program, multiple data' (SPMD) programming.  Under the SPMD model, the programmer writes a program that generally appears  to be a regular serial program, though the execution model is actually that  a number of program instances execute in parallel on the hardware.
