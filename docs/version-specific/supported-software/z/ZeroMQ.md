# ZeroMQ

ZeroMQ looks like an embeddable networking library but acts like a concurrency framework.  It gives you sockets that carry atomic messages across various transports like in-process,  inter-process, TCP, and multicast. You can connect sockets N-to-N with patterns like fanout,  pub-sub, task distribution, and request-reply. It's fast enough to be the fabric for clustered  products. Its asynchronous I/O model gives you scalable multicore applications, built as asynchronous  message-processing tasks. It has a score of language APIs and runs on most operating systems.
