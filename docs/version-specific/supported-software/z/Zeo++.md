# Zeo++

Zeo++ is a software package for analysis of crystalline porous materials.     Zeo++ can be used to perform geometry-based analysis of structure and     topology of the void space inside a material,     to assemble or alternate structures as well as to generate structure     representations to be used in structure similarity calculations.     Zeo++ can be used to either analyze a single structure or perform high-throughput analysis of a large database.
