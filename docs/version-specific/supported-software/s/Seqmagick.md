# Seqmagick

We often have to convert between sequence formats and do little tasks on them, and it's not worth   writing scripts for that. Seqmagick is a kickass little utility built in the spirit of imagemagick to expose the   file format conversion in Biopython in a convenient way. Instead of having a big mess of scripts, there is one that   takes arguments.
