The Succinct Data Structure Library (SDSL) is a powerful and flexible C++11 library implementing  succinct data structures. In total, the library contains the highlights of 40 research publications. Succinct  data structures can represent an object (such as a bitvector or a tree) in space close to the information-theoretic  lower bound of the object while supporting operations of the original object efficiently. The theoretical time  complexity of an operation performed on the classical data structure and the equivalent succinct data structure  are (most of the time) identical.
