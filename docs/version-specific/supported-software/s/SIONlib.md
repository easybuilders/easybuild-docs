# SIONlib

SIONlib is a scalable I/O library for parallel access to task-local files.  The library not only supports writing and reading binary data to or from  several thousands of processors into a single or a small number of physical  files, but also provides global open and close functions to access SIONlib  files in parallel. This package provides a stripped-down installation of  SIONlib for use with performance tools (e.g., Score-P), with renamed symbols  to avoid conflicts when an application using SIONlib itself is linked against  a tool requiring a different SIONlib version.
