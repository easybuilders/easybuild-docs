# SIONlib

SIONlib is a scalable I/O library for parallel access to task-local files.  The library not only supports writing and reading binary data to or from several thousands of  processors into a single or a small number of physical files, but also provides global open  and close functions to access SIONlib files in parallel. This package provides a stripped-down  installation of SIONlib for use with performance tools (e.g., Score-P), with renamed symbols  to avoid conflicts when an application using SIONlib itself is linked against a tool requiring  a different SIONlib version.
