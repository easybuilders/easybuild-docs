# SAW

Stereo-seq Analysis Workflow (SAW) software suite is a set of  pipelines bundled to map sequenced reads to their spatial location on the tissue  section, quantify spatial feature expression, and visually present spatial expression  distribution. SAW processes the data from the Stereo-seq sequencing platform, combined  with microscope images, to generate spatial feature expression matrices. Analysts can  use the output files as a starting point to perform downstream analysis.
