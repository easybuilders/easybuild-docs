# SpaceRanger

Space Ranger is a set of analysis pipelines that process Visium spatial RNA-seq output and brightfield microscope images in order to detect tissue, align reads, generate feature-spot matrices, perform clustering and gene expression analysis, and place spots in spatial context on the slide image.
