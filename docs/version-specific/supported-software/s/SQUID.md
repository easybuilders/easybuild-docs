# SQUID

Single-cell RNA Quantity Informed Deconvolution. SQUID is an R package for conducting (tumor) deconvolution analyses. SQUID executes a combination of RNA-Seq transformation and dampened weighted least-squares deconvolution to predict the composition of cell mixtures and tissue samples based on the concurrent RNA-Seq and scnRNA-Seq profiles. SQUID harnesses the power of concurrent RNA-Seq and scnRNA-Seq profiling, outperforming other methods in predicting the composition of cell mixtures and tissue samples.
