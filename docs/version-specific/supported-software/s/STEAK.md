# STEAK

Detects integrations of any sort in high-throughput  sequencing (HTS) data. STEAK was built for validating and discovering  transposable element (TE) and retroviral integrations in a variety of  HTS data. The software performs on both single-end (SE) and paired-end ( PE) libraries and on a variety of HTS sequencing strategies. It can  be applied to a broad range of research interests and clinical uses  such as population genetic studies and detecting polymorphic integrations.
