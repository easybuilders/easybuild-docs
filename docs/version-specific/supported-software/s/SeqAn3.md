# SeqAn3

SeqAn is an open source C++ library   of efficient algorithms and data structures for the   analysis of sequences with the focus on biological   data. Our library applies a unique generic design   that guarantees high performance, generality,   extensibility, and integration with other libraries.   SeqAn is easy to use and simplifies the development   of new software tools with a minimal loss of   performance.
