# YACS

YACS was created as a lightweight library to define and manage system configurations, such as those commonly found in software designed for scientific experimentation. These "configurations" typically cover concepts like hyperparameters used in training a machine learning model or configurable model hyperparameters, such as the depth of a convolutional neural network.
