# bases2fastq

Bases2Fastq Software demultiplexes sequencing data and converts base calls   into FASTQ files for secondary analysis with the FASTQ-compatible software of your choice.   The Element AVITIâ„¢ System records base calls, which are the main output of a sequencing run,  with associated quality scores (Q-scores) in bases files. Bases files must be converted into  the FASTQ file format for secondary analysis.   To generate QC reports, also load BeautifulSoup and bokeh.
