BirdNET is a research platform that aims at recognizing birds by sound at scale. We support various hardware and operating systems such as Arduino microcontrollers, the Raspberry Pi,  smartphones, web browsers, workstation PCs, and even cloud services. BirdNET is a citizen science  platform as well as an analysis software for extremely large collections of audio.
