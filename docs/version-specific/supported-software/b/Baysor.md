# Baysor

Baysor is a tool for performing cell segmentation on imaging-based spatial transcriptomics data.  It optimizes segmentation considering the likelihood of transcriptional composition, size and  shape of the cell. The approach can take into account nuclear or cytoplasm staining, however,  can also perform segmentation based on the detected molecules alone.
