# Brotli-python

Brotli is a generic-purpose lossless compression algorithm that compresses data using a combination  of a modern variant of the LZ77 algorithm, Huffman coding and 2nd order context modeling, with a compression ratio  comparable to the best currently available general-purpose compression methods. It is similar in speed with deflate  but offers more dense compression. The specification of the Brotli Compressed Data Format is defined in RFC 7932.
