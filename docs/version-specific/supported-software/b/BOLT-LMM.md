# BOLT-LMM

The BOLT-LMM algorithm computes statistics for testing association between phenotype  and genotypes using a linear mixed model (LMM) [1]. By default, BOLT-LMM assumes a Bayesian  mixture-of-normals prior for the random effect attributed to SNPs other than the one being tested.  This model generalizes the standard "infinitesimal" mixed model used by previous mixed model  association methods (e.g., EMMAX, FaST-LMM, GEMMA, GRAMMAR-Gamma, GCTA-LOCO), providing an  opportunity for increased power to detect associations while controlling false  positives. Additionally, BOLT-LMM applies algorithmic advances to compute mixed model association  statistics much faster than eigendecomposition-based methods, both when using the Bayesian mixture  model and when specialized to standard mixed model association.
