# BLAKE3-C

BLAKE3 is a cryptographic hash function that is: Much faster than MD5, SHA-1, SHA-2, SHA-3, and BLAKE2. Secure, unlike MD5 and SHA-1. And secure against length extension, unlike SHA-2. Highly parallelizable across any number of threads and SIMD lanes, because it's a Merkle tree on the inside. Capable of verified streaming and incremental updates, again because it's a Merkle tree. A PRF, MAC, KDF, and XOF, as well as a regular hash.
