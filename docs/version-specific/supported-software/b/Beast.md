# Beast

BEAST is a cross-platform program for Bayesian MCMC analysis of molecular   sequences. It is entirely orientated towards rooted, time-measured phylogenies inferred using   strict or relaxed molecular clock models. It can be used as a method of reconstructing phylogenies   but is also a framework for testing evolutionary hypotheses without conditioning on a single   tree topology. BEAST uses MCMC to average over tree space, so that each tree is weighted   proportional to its posterior probability.
