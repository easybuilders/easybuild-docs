# Mmg

Mmg is an open source software for simplicial remeshing. It provides 3 applications and 4 libraries:     the mmg2d application and the libmmg2d library: adaptation and optimization of a two-dimensional triangulation         and generation of a triangulation from a set of points or from given boundary edges     the mmgs application and the libmmgs library: adaptation and optimization of a surface triangulation         and isovalue discretization     the mmg3d application and the libmmg3d library: adaptation and optimization of a tetrahedral mesh         and implicit domain meshing     the libmmg library gathering the libmmg2d, libmmgs and libmmg3d libraries
