# Maude

Maude is a high-performance reflective language and system supporting both equational and rewriting  logic specification and programming for a wide range of applications. Maude has been influenced in important ways by  the OBJ3 language, which can be regarded as an equational logic sublanguage. Besides supporting equational  specification and programming, Maude also supports rewriting logic computation.
