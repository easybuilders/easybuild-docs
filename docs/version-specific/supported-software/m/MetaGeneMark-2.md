# MetaGeneMark-2

MetaGeneMark-2 is an unsupervised metagenomic gene finder. It improves on MetaGeneMark by adding models for better gene start prediction, as well as automatic selection of genetic code (4 or 11). The models for gene start prediction are based in part on the work done for GeneMarkS-2; they include Shine-Dalgarno RBS, non-Shine-Dalgarno (or non-canonical) RBS, and bacterial and archaeal promoter models (for use in cases of leaderless transcription).
