# MAQAO

MAQAO (Modular Assembly Quality Analyzer and Optimizer) is a performance analysis and optimization framework operating at binary level with a focus on core performance. Its main goal of is to guide application developers along the optimization process through synthetic reports and hints.  MAQAO mixes both dynamic and static analyses based on its ability to reconstruct high level structures such as functions and loops from an application binary. Since MAQAO operates at binary level, it is agnostic with regard to the language used in the source code and does not require recompiling the application to perform analyses.
