# minimap2

Minimap2 is a fast sequence mapping and alignment program that can find overlaps between  long noisy reads, or map long reads or their assemblies to a reference genome optionally with detailed  alignment (i.e. CIGAR). At present, it works efficiently with query sequences from a few kilobases to  ~100 megabases in length at an error rate ~15%. Minimap2 outputs in the PAF or the SAM format. On limited  test data sets, minimap2 is over 20 times faster than most other long-read aligners. It will replace  BWA-MEM for long reads and contig alignment.
