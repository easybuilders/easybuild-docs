# MUSCLE

MUSCLE is one of the best-performing multiple alignment programs  according to published benchmark tests, with accuracy and speed that are consistently  better than CLUSTALW. MUSCLE can align hundreds of sequences in seconds. Most users  learn everything they need to know about MUSCLE in a few minutes-only a handful of  command-line options are needed to perform common alignment tasks.
