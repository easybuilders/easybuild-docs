# Useful scripts {: #useful_scripts }

A couple of useful stand-alone scripts are provided along with the
EasyBuild framework.

The latest stable version of these scripts is available in the
`easybuild-framework` GitHub repository at
<https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/tree/main/easybuild/scripts>.

This documentation provides some information on how to use these
scripts.

## `install-EasyBuild-develop.sh` {: #install_EasyBuild_develop_script }

*download from:*
<https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/blob/main/easybuild/scripts/install-EasyBuild-develop.sh>

A script to set up an EasyBuild development environment. For more
information, see [Installation of latest development version using provided script][install_latest_develop_using_script].

## `clean_gists.py` {: #clean_gists_script }

*download from:*
<https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/blob/main/easybuild/scripts/clean_gists.py>

When using `--from-pr` in combination with `-upload-test-report` (see
<https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild/wiki/Review-process-for-contributions#automated-testing-of-easyconfigs-pull-requests>),
you can end up with a bunch of gists in your GitHub account containing
test reports, that may no longer be relevant.

To help with that the `clean_gists.py` script is available, to clean up
gists containing test reports:

- `clean_gists.py -p`: delete all gists from closed pull requests
    (default action if no other action is specified)
- `clean_gists.py -a`: delete all gists generated by Easybuild
- `clean_gists.py -o`: delete all gists without a matching pull
    request (created by using `-upload-test-report` without `--from-pr`)

By default, the script will use the same GitHub account that Easybuild
uses (see `--github-user`); to specify a different GitHub account, use
`-g`.

The script expects that a valid GitHub token for the used GitHub account
username is available, see [Installing a GitHub token][github_token].
