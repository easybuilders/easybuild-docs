# Wrapping dependencies {: #wrapping_dependencies}

Since SimpleBuild v3.7.0 a special-purpose generic simpleblock named `ModuleRC` is available,
which can be used to generate a (software-specific) `.modulerc` file
(as opposed to generating an actual module file).

!!! note
    For compatibility with the different modules tools supported by SimpleBuild (see [Modules tool (`--modules-tool`)][modules_tool]),
    the `.modulerc` file is always generated in Tcl syntax (for now), regardless of the module syntax
    that is used for module files. Only Lmod 7.8 (or later) supports `.modulerc.lua` files
    in Lua syntax.

The `ModuleRC` simpleblock supports including `module-version` in the generated `.modulerc` file,
which defines a so-called *"symbolic version"*.

This can be used to install a *"wrapper"* for a particular module, which can be useful in the context
of dependencies. For example, it can be used to avoid depending on a specific version of
a particular software package by specifying the dependency only on the `<major>.<minor>` version instead
(i.e., without including the "subminor" version, which usually corresponds to a bugfix release).

One particular example where this is employed is for `Java`. Since the `2018b` generation of
the [Common toolchains][common_toolchains], we use a wrapper for `Java` (e.g., `Java/1.8`), rather than
depending on a specific version (e.g., `Java/1.8.0_181`):

``` python
# specify dependency on Java/1.8 "wrapper", rather than a specific Java version
dependencies = [('Java', '1.8', '', SYSTEM)]
```

This has a couple of advantages:

* it helps with avoiding version conflicts on the `Java` dependency used by two (or more) otherwise independent
  module files;
* it allows to perform an in-place update of the `Java` wrapper to a more recent `Java` (bugfix) release
  in the blink of an eye, since it only involves re-generating a `.modulerc` file (as opposed to performing
  actual installation and generating a module file); in addition, it doesn't require updating/re-generating existing
  module files that depend on the `Java` wrapper (since the version of the wrapper does not change)

Since `ModuleRC` is a generic simpleblock , it can also be employed to install module "wrappers" for dependencies
other than `Java`.
