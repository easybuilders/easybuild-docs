# Using external modules {: #using_external_modules }

Since SimpleBuild v2.1, support for using modules that were not installed via SimpleBuild is available.
We refer to such modules as *external modules*.

This can be useful to reuse vendor-supplied modules, for example on Cray systems.


## Using external modules as dependencies

External modules can be used as dependencies, by including the module name in the `dependencies` list (see
[Dependencies][dependency_specs]), along with the `EXTERNAL_MODULE` constant marker.

For example, to specify the readily available module `fftw/3.3.4.2` as a dependency:

``` python
dependencies = [('fftw/3.3.4.2', EXTERNAL_MODULE)]
```

For such dependencies, SimpleBuild will:

* load the module before initiating the software build and install procedure
* include a '`module load`' statement in the generated module file (for non-build dependencies)

If the specified module is not available, SimpleBuild will exit with an error message stating that the dependency can
not be resolved because the module could not be found. It will *not* search for a matching simpleconfig file in order to
try and install the module to resolve the dependency.


## Metadata for external modules {: #using_external_modules_metadata }

Since very little information is available for external modules based on the dependency specification alone (i.e., only
the module name), metadata can be supplied to SimpleBuild for external modules.

Using the `--external-modules-metadata` configuration option, the location of one or more files can be specified that
provide such metadata. The files are expected to be in INI format, with a section per module name and key-value
assignments denoting the metadata specific to that module.

Format:

``` ini
[modulename]
key1 = value1
key2 = value2, value3
```

### Default

Up until SimpleBuild v2.6.0, no metadata for external modules was available by default.

Since SimpleBuild v2.7.0, a file providing metadata for Cray-provided modules on Cray systems is included,
and is active by default (i.e., unless other files are specified via `--external-modules-metadata`);
see <https://github.com/simplebuilders/simplebuild-framework/blob/main/etc/cray_external_modules_metadata.cfg>.

### Using wildcards

Since SimpleBuild v4.1.0, you can use so-called *glob patterns* to specify a list of paths
to `--external-modules-metadata`, using wildcard characters like `*` and `?`.

For example, to specify that the metadata for external modules in all `*.cfg` files in the directory `/example`
should be taken into account, you can use:

``` shell
export SIMPLEBUILD_EXTERNAL_MODULES_METADATA='/example/*.cfg'
```

### Example

For example, the following file provides metadata for a handful of modules that may be provided on Cray systems:

``` ini 
[cray-hdf5/1.8.13]
name = HDF5
version = 1.8.13
prefix = HDF5_DIR

[cray-hdf5-parallel/1.8.13]
name = HDF5
version = 1.8.13
prefix = /opt/cray/hdf5-parallel/1.8.13/GNU/49

[cray-netcdf/4.3.2]
name = netCDF, netCDF-Fortran
version = 4.3.2, 4.3.2
prefix = NETCDF_DIR

[fftw/3.3.4.5]
name = FFTW
version = 3.3.4.5
prefix = FFTW_INC/..
```

### Supported metadata values

The following keys are supported:

* `name`: specifies the software name(s) that is (are) provided by the module
* `version`: specifies the software version(s) that is (are) provided by the module
* `prefix`: specifies the installation prefix of the software that is provided by the module

For `prefix`, a couple of different options are available, i.e.:

* specifying an absolute path (cfr. `cray-hdf5-parallel/1.8.13` in the example above)
* specifying the environment variable that is defined by the module and provides the installation prefix
  (cfr. `cray-netcdf/4.3.2` in the example above)
   * this can be optionally combined with a relative path that serves as a 'correction'
     (cfr. `fftw/3.3.4.5` in the example above) *[supported since SimpleBuild v2.7.0]*

Any other keys are simply ignored.

!!! note
    When both `name` and `version` are specified, they must provide an *equal number of values*
    (see for example the `cray-netcdf` example above).

### Handling of provided metadata

Using the provided metadata, SimpleBuild will define environment variables that are also defined by modules that are
generated by SimpleBuild itself, if an external module for which metadata is available is loaded as a dependency.

In particular, for each software name that is specified:

* the corresponding environment variable `$EBROOT<NAME>` is defined to the specified `prefix` value (if any)
* the corresponding environment variable `$EBVERSION<NAME>` is defined to the corresponding `version` value (if any)

For example, for the external modules for which metadata is provided in the example above, the following
environment variables are set in the build environment when the module is used as a dependency:

* for `cray-hdf5/1.8.1.13`:
   * `$EBROOTHDF5` = `$HDF5_DIR`
   * `$EBVERSIONHDF5` = `1.8.13`
* for `cray-hdf5-parallel/1.8.13`:
   * `$EBROOTHDF5` = `/opt/cray/hdf5-parallel/1.8.13/GNU/49`
   * `$EBVERSIONHDF5` = `1.8.13`
* for `cray-netcdf/4.3.2`:
   * `$EBROOTNETCDF` = `$NETCDF_DIR`
   * `$EBROOTNETCDFMINFORTRAN` = `$NETCDF_DIR`
   * `$EBVERSIONNETCDF` = `4.3.2`
   * `$EBVERSIONNETCDFMINFORTRAN` = `4.3.2`
* for `fftw/3.3.4.5`:
   * `$EBROOTFFTW` = `$FFTW_INC/../`
   * `$EBVERSIONFFTW` = `3.3.4.5`

The `get_software_root` and `get_software_version` functions that are commonly used occasionally in simpleblocks
pick up the `$EBROOT*` and `$EBVERSION*` environment variables, respectively.
