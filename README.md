# SimpleBuild documentation

This repository contains the *sources* of the SimpleBuild documentation, which is hosted at <https://docs.simplebuild.io>.

## Format

The documentation sources are located in the [docs subdirectory](https://github.com/simplebuilders/simplebuild-docs/tree/main/docs).

They are written in [MarkDown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) format, and rendered using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org),
and the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material) theme.

Useful links:

- Reference guide for Material for MkDocs: <https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference>

### Writing

When writing content for the SimpleBuild documentation, it is useful to get a live preview of how things will look.

Next to the letting `mkdocs` serve a local copy of the full SimpleBuild documentation so you can view it in your browser
(see below), you can also use online services for this. This will allow you to see a live version of standard
Markdown, but it will not give you a live preview of the MkDocs specific Markdown extensions.

At <https://markdownlivepreview.com> you can see a live preview while editing content in MarkDown format.

[HackMD (https://hackmd.io)](https://hackmd.io) is a MarkDown note service which provides live previewing of
the rendered note while you edit in MarkDown format, and *collaborative editing* of content.

Create a new note via <https://hackmd.io/new> to preview your content while editing it in MarkDown,
and share the note URL with others if you would like to work together on some content.

To save work-in-progress notes and get back to them later, create a dedicated HackMD account,
or sign in using your GitHub/Google/... account, via <https://hackmd.io/login>.

## Publishing

The documentation is automatically built and published to <https://docs.simplebuild.io> on every push to the `main` branch of this repository.

This is taken care of by the [`deploy` GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/simplebuilders/simplebuild-docs/tree/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml).

## Using `mkdocs`

### Installing `mkdocs`

To install all the required `mkdocs` Python packages, use the provided [requirements.txt](https://github.com/simplebuilders/simplebuild-docs/tree/main/requirements.txt) file:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Building

To build the documentation, use:

```shell
mkdocs build
```

or use the `Makefile` that is provided in this repository:

```shell
make
```

### Testing

To test whether the documentation is building correctly, and whether all (internal) links are correct, use:

```shell
mkdocs build --strict
```

or

```shell
make test
```

These commands will exit with a non-zero exit code if `mkdocs` produces any errors or warnings.

### Previewing

To see a local preview of the rendered documentation in your browser, use

```shell
mkdocs serve
```

or

```shell
make preview
```

and click the link that is provided, for example:

```shell
INFO     -  Documentation built in 0.24 seconds
INFO     -  [17:52:07] Watching paths for changes: 'docs', 'mkdocs.yml'
INFO     -  [17:52:07] Serving on http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

This preview of the rendered documentation will automatically refresh when the documentation sources are updated!

### SimpleBuild Framework API

The API documentation for the SimpleBuild Framework is generated automatically if the SimpleBuild framework code is found in ``src``:

```shell
mkdir src
cd src
git clone git@github.com:simplebuilders/simplebuild-framework.git
```

If the SimpleBuild Framework is not found then the `mkdocs` build of the documentation will be faster, but this will cause a number of warnings messages to be printed.


## Contributing
